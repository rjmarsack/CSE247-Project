Current Main Bug

1.Run server
2. run 3 clients
3.Chose Tic Tac Toe For every client
4. the first client wil not connect Properly , but every other client after will connect. 
line 27 in MainGameServer seems to be the cause:  Socket connectionSocket = listener.accept();

The current GUI for Tic Tac Toe uses image icons, 
but with the current set up the images are not displayed properly. This will be Fixed in a later itteration.
